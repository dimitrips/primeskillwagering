FrontStrike Wagering Project

ðŸ“– Overview

The FrontStrike Wagering Project is a complete blockchain-based wagering system built for the FPS game FrontStrike. It consists of three main components:

Smart Contract â€” A Solana-based smart contract that handles deposits, in-game purchases, match result processing, and automated payouts.

API Handler â€” A Node.js backend that abstracts the complexity of Solana interactions, providing simple RESTful endpoints for game servers to communicate with the blockchain.

Testing Suite â€” Full Postman test suite and unit tests for validating both the smart contract and API functionality.
